/*
Spec

Tools:
- `web_fetch` - Fetches a URL from the internet and extracts its contents as markdown. Images are omitted.
    - `url` (string, required): URL to fetch
        - if no protocol, should default to https:// - so input can be either like `https://example.com` or like `example.com`
    - `max_length` (integer, optional): Maximum number of characters to return (default: 5000).
    - `start_index` (integer, optional): Start content from this character index (default: 0). Useful if a previous fetch was truncated and more context is required.
    - `raw` (boolean, optional): Get the raw HTML content of the page without markdown conversion (default: false).
    - Return values:
        - webpage content
        - `<error>No more content available.</error>`
        - webpage content + `<warning>Content truncated. Call the fetch tool with a start_index of {next_start} to get more content.</warning>`
        - `<error>Markdown conversion failed. You may try again with raw = true.</error>`
        - fetch errors appear like `<error>Error fetching webpage: 403 Unauthorized</error>`
- `web_search` - Searches the web to produce a report (with citations) on a topic. Uses Perplexity Sonar (via Perplexity or OpenRouter) to produce the report.
    - `query` (string, required): The topic to search for.
    - Return values: list of webpages
- `web_images` - Finds public images and returns ready-to-render markdown image URLs.
    - `query` (string, required): The image subject to search for.
    - Return values: markdown images with source links
